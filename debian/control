Description: Shell script to open new tabs in Yakuake
 yaknewtab is a (mostly) POSIX shell script that greatly simplifies the
 creation of new tabs/sessions in Yakuake.
 .
 It uses simple logic to determine the D-Bus command line tool needed to
 communicate with the already-running Yakuake process, adding the specifics
 (supplied as standard POSIX flags and arguments) in the necessary syntax to
 generate the desired result.
